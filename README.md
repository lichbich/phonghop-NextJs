## GIT rules
* All changes need to be done in a new branch prefixed by `feature/` or `hotfix/` for which then a pull request is made to the `develop` branch.
Once we create a new release we will create a pull request from `develop` to the `master` branch.
* Use a program like `SourceTree` to make it easier to manage what to commit.
* Make you commits small and logical
* Every new change needs to be in a seperated branch
* Branch name example: [feature/hotfix/bug/..etc]/[issue number]-issue-title (e.g. feature/112-adding-login-page)
* Merge request name example: [issue number] | issue title (e.g. 112 | Adding login page)
